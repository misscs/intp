Multi-part project: 

1. updating the Deep Dish/Waves of Change community meida map, and 
2. adding community media to the map. 


We ended the year with student presentation in Vicky's Garden. 

If we were to do the project again we would contain the age range to high school students. 

I think this project shows the need to develop community media services that can serve as a low cost option for community organizations. It builds a nice closed loop system where the community orgs work with local students.

Being directly in Harlem meant we could easily take a trip to visit the different community organizations. Student teams could go over and film or ask questions during the day. Everything was within walking distance.
