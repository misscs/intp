Two part project: updating the map and also adding community media to the map. We focused more on the latter which, in hindsight, made me feel like the project was not as successful as it could have been. In the end, after many years, I realized that I was just overly ambitious--can you believe they also learned Git?

We ended the year with student presentation in Vicky's Garden. 

If we were to do the project again we would contain the age range to high school students. 

I think this project shows the need to develop community media that serves as low cost option for community organizations. It builds a nice closed loop system where the community orgs work with local students. 

Being directly in Harlem meant we could easily take a trip to visit the different community organizations. Student teams could go over and film or ask questions during the day. Everything was within walking distance.
